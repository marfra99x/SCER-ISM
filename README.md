## ðŸ“„ Overview

This work addresses the problem of matching a **determinate pattern** against an **indeterminate text**, where each text position may represent a set of possible characters. We focus on two prominent substring-consistent equivalence relations (SCERs):

- **Order-Preserving Matching**
- **Parameterized Matching**

Our main contribution is a set of **bitwise-compatible** algorithms that:
- Avoid explicit set operations.
- Use **sum-free sequences** (powers of two) for encoding.
- Support constant-time character comparisons via bitwise operations.
- Achieve optimal or near-optimal performance in both theory and practice.

## âš¡ Performance

The algorithms are:
- **Order-Preserving Matching**: `O(n)` time, in-place, with constant-time operations.
- **Parameterized Matching**: `O(n + Ïƒ_p âˆš(Ïƒ_p^x Ïƒ_p^y))` time via reduction to bipartite matching.

## ðŸ›  Code Structure

- `oppm.c`: Bit-parallel algorithm for Order-Preserving Pattern Matching.
- `pism.c`: Algorithm for Parameterized Matching with indeterminate text.

The parameterized matcher reduces injectivity enforcement to **maximum bipartite matching**, solved using the **Hopcroft-Karp algorithm**.
